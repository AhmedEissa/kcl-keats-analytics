KEATS Analytics:
Learning analytics is an emergent field of research that promises to harness the power of advances in educational data mining, interpretation, visualization, and modelling to improve understandings of teaching and learning, and to tailor education to individual students more effectively.

KEATS Analytics is a College Teaching -funded project led by Dr. Jonathan San Diego, whose main aims are:

    Investigate feedback in e-learning using analytics via Moodle.
    Allow institutions to gather information which can be used for evaluating studentsâ€™ online behaviour and engagement in the learning process.
    Optimize opportunities for online learning.
    Enhance TEL environments.
    Identify various pedagogical disciplinary practices and build better pedagogies.

    Researching virtual learning within Moodle
    Moodle allows institutions to accumulate information for analyzing students' learning. Students' activities and their e-learning interactions are automatically captured in the form of logged computer operations. These can then be translated into a display that teachers can interpret easily and that students can appreciate (e.g. displays representing the pageviews, location of users, participation in activities). KEATS Analytics has been developed and designed to offer feedback to teachers about learner activities in relation to the design, structure, and contents of a module. It also provides feedback to students on how they are using the resources in a learning environment.
